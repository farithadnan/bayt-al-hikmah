An **algorithm** is a **set of well-defined instructions or a "recipe" used to solve computational problems**. For example, imagine you have a list of numbers, and you want to sort them in ascending order, or perhaps you have a maze or roadmap, and you need to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. In such cases, algorithms are the solution!

Algorithms enable us to solve complex problems efficiently. Theyâ€™re so important that they power many of the tools and technologies we use every day. For instance, the search engine you rely on uses algorithms to query results tailored to your preferences and personalization. Algorithm is not strictly used under computer science, it also being used for quantum mechanics, economic and evolution. In short, algorithms are everywhere.
