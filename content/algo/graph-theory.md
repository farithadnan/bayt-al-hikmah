In **graph theory**, a **graph** is a mathematical structure used **to model relationships between objects**. It's a set of **[[./basic-concept-of-graph-theory.md|vertices]]** (nodes) connected by **[[./basic-concept-of-graph-theory.md#Edges or Links|edges]]** (lines). Graphs are widely used in computer science, networking, and real-world problem modeling.

> [!example] **Graph in Real Life**  
> Some real-life examples of graphs include:
>
> - **Social Networks**: People represent **vertices**, and the connections (e.g., friendships or followers) represent **edges**.
> - **Transportation Networks**: Locations (e.g., cities or train stations) represent **vertices**, and the roads, train tracks, or flight routes connecting them represent **edges**.
> - **Internet**: Websites represent **vertices**, and the hyperlinks or data connections between them represent **edges**.

- [[./basic-concept-of-graph-theory.md#Edges or Links|Edge]]
- [[./basic-concept-of-graph-theory.md#Loops|Loop]]

## Types of Graphs

There are various types of graphs in graph theory and here is some of them:

- [[Null Graph]]
- [[Trivial Graph]]
- [[Simple Graph]]
- [[Multigraph Graph]]
- [[Undirected Graph]]
- [[Directed Graph]]
- [[Weighted Graphs]]
- [[Complete Graph]]
- [[Bipartite Graphs]]
