Welcome to my digital garden, the name is inspired by the legendary [Bayt al-Hikmah](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bayt-al-Hikmah). Here, I collect thoughts, notes, and things I find interesting— mostly on web development, sometimes AI, and whatever else sparks curiosity. It’s not really a blog, just a place to store and share what I learn.
