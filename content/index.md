I'm Farith, and this is my digital garden. Its name is inspired by the legendary [Bayt al-Hikmah](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bayt-al-Hikmah) library. Here, I collect thoughts, notes, and interesting findsâ€”mostly on web development, sometimes AI, and whatever else sparks my curiosity. Itâ€™s not really a blog, just a place to store and share what I learn.
