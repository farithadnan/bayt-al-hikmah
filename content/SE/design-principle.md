**Design principles** [^1] are **guidelines** that help developers create **better, maintainable, and scalable software**. These principles promote writing code that is **easy to understand, extend, and maintain**. Think of them as a **best-practice handbook** for software development.

## Examples

Below is an example of the principles used during development:

1. [[SOLID Principle]] (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
2. [[DRY]] (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)
3. [[KISS]] (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
4. [[YAGNI]] (You Ainâ€™t Gonna Need It)
